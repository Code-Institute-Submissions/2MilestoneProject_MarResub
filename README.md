# HOLi-Dreams #

For the second Milestone Project, I have decided to develop the concept of a Holiday Agency that launches three different holiday packages
every month. The site is very visual and engaging. Allows the user to see which kind of holiday pack is been launched each month and request full information from the agency that will help out on the booking and assessing process.
 
## UX ##

Project Goals:

 *Offer a new point of view in terms of booking holidays through an agency.
 * Engage with actual and future clients, as new products are always available using pictures of the places and the actual location of the three possible destinations.
 * Provide the best service when assessing and presenting the travel options, so clients can fulfill their needs.

### Design Process ###

##### Strategy Plane: ####

The main goal of the website is to ease the effort of the clients when looking for a getaway. The holiday packs are available only during
one month to buy or reserve but the date of the trip can be anytime.
A more visual and detailed approach.


#### Scope Plane: ####

The features of the website were developed based on user needs. What a holiday finder website should have?
 * How many pages it will have.
 * Decide if the pages will be scrollable or separate.
 * Do online researches on other holiday websites and applications.
 * Use my personal experience as a consumer.

#### Skeleton Plane: #### 

At this step of the designing process, I have used Balsamiq wireframes to capture my overall idea and organization of the project.
Also I had the mentor session at this point, where I could decide what was the best structure of the project. Visual design and also the color palette
I wanted to use, in addition I started to decide the images I will choose, or at least the type I would look for.

   <img src="assets/img/wireframes/wf1.jpg" alt="wireframe1" width="400" height="400"/>
   <img src="assets/img/wireframes/wf2.jpg" alt="wireframe2" width="400" height="400"/> 
   <img src="assets/img/wireframes/wf3.jpg" alt="wireframe3" width="400" height="400"/>  
    
   

 
#### Surface Plane: ####

At this stage of the process, I proceeded to start to design the website using Bootstrap. 
At the beginning of the designing process I decided to create a site which counted with at least 3 different and independent page, 
however, I was not happy with the results, from the User experience perspective and I decided to change it and do a scrollable website.

Colors used from the CSS3 palette color available at [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp)

## Features ##

The website counts with three pages, likable by the navbar, making the navigation easy and handy; home page, destination page, and contact page.

1. The Home page counts with a full-screen landing image, the slogan and animated text presenting the destinations available of the month, and google maps direct access where you can quickly spot the locations.
2. The Destinations page, offers a bootstrap interactive card layout, with images and a full description of the options you can choose.
3. The Contact page invites the user to connect with the agency directly and have a personalized experience.

Technologies Used:
 1. HTML5: Used to create the form and the content of the web site
	te.
 2.	CSS3 : Used to style the HTML
 3. Bootstrap Frameworks: Used some components; Header, footer, and the card layout. 
    Also used the grid system to make the website responsive for all-size devices.
 4. JavaScript to implement the interactive and contemporaneous approach. 
 5. Gitpod and Github to write, test and deploy my code. 
 6. JQuery The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing ##

I have Validated the code using: 
 * HTML   [HTML-Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) 
 * CSS    [CSS-Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
   

Tested the website in different browsers:    
* Chrome
* Edge
* Mozilla Firefox 
* Safary
    
I have also used the Inspect tool from Google Chrome to test the responsiveness of the website in different size devices and no errors have been shown
at the console. 
I have encountered few issues during the code validation process:
 1. Few CSS properties had the wrong attributes - fixed
 2. Some HTML tags were at the wrong position - fixed
 3. The "Submit" button of the contact page was outside the form. - fixed
 4. Encountered few issues when linking the emailJS API to my website getting a 404 error back. 
 To resolve the issue I had to move the email JS code to a different file (email.js)
 5. When testing the email form you see 200 code.
